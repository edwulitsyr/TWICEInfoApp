        People just can\'t leave me alone not for a single moment\n
        I\'m so pretty\n
        I make everyone so smitten\n
        No matter which way I go, the floors are all red\n
        Like walking down the red carpet\n
        Everyone is staring at me oh\n
         \n
        Some people ask "Who\'s your mama?"\n
        They take a fresh approach\n
        But I don\'t feel a thing oh\n
        But I want to love somebody\n
        Wanna fall in love, baby\n
        Listen up my boy\n
         \n
        I\'m waiting for someone who can make me feel\n
        Something like never before\n
        (That\'s who I\'m waiting for)\n
        I\'ll wait no matter how long it takes\n
        I just wanna fall in love\n
         \n
        What to do, keep me still\n
        Make me like ooh-ahh ooh-ahh\n
        Fake, fake, an empty-hearted fake\n
        Goodbye and good riddance huh (Like ooh-ahh)\n
        What to do, make me speechless\n

        Bla la la la, stop talking, start doing\n
        Make me feel huh (Like ooh-ahh)\n
         \n
        Look at me and see me again\n
        Pass by once and look back (Twice)\n
        Wherever I go, I go without makeup\n
        But I\'m the one who shines the most\n
        Flat shoes can\'t hide my high value\n
         \n
        Movie-like scenes run through my head la la la\n
        Just thinking about it\n
        Makes me excited yeah\n
        Now I want to love somebody\n
        Wanna fall in love baby\n
        Listen up my boy\n
         \n

        Don\'t wanna start with just anybody\n
        I\'m not the kind of girl who gives herself away so easily\n
         \n
        Let me see how you gonna treat me\n
        I ain\'t no easy\n
        Better think about it twice\n

        You make me feel special\n
         \n
        It\'s just one of these days\n
        All of the sudden feeling lost, don\'t know why\n
        Can\'t figure out where I belong, regret the path I chose\n
        Afraid, I keep my head down\n
         \n
        But on those days you tell me,\n
        “You\'re shining so bright, a star in the night\n
        You\'re precious, sparkling like a diamond”\n
        Everything\'s alright\n

        Had to escape just for a while\n
        Was too afraid to face the world\n
        As if there\'s nothing worth living, to me\n
        It\'s like nothing could make me believe\n
        So I sat and stared at my reflection\n
         \n
        But then you appeared, in front of me, here\n
        The warmest smile, while holding out your hand\n
        Everything\'s alright\n
        Turning from Nobody into a Somebody\n
        To an unbreakable me\n

        On the gloomiest cloudy days without sunshine\n
        You become my shining light\n
        That\'s what you do\n
        Make the brightest things out of something dark\n
        I owe it to you\n
        Because you make me feel\n
         \n
        You make me feel special\n

        Now for sure, stop the clock clock, I\'ll do all the talk talk,\n
        Too delusional, I\'m just too delusional.\n
         \n
        Thought I was all grown up, became a lady,\n
        Thought I could now just freely make\n
        My own choices, have everything my way.\n
        I keep saying no, telling you to go,\n
        But in truth I\'ve been, stuck to stuck to you my baby.\n

        Lose control, all my heart and soul\n
         \n
        Whenever our eyes meet\n
        My heart stops and we\'re frozen in time\n
        Suddenly it\'s just the two of us\n
        Im hopelessly\n
        Head over heels Passion\n
        Ah, ah\n
         \n
        Drawn into eternity\n
        Feeling dizzy\n
        It\'s like magic\n
        Unpredictable my heart flutters\n
        Drifting away\n
        Sweet magic\n
         \n
        Your eyes, your smile, your hands, your words\n
        You will always be the one\n
        Feeling restless\n
        Can\'t you see? all night\n
         \n
        Lose control, all my heart and soul (All my heart and soul)\n
        (Magic)\n
        Lose control, all my heart and soul (Oh, magic)\n
